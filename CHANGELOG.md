### [7.0.2](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/java-sdk/compare/7.0.1...7.0.2) (2026-07-06)


### Bug Fixes

* **ENG-11425:** note GH Packages publish uses native GITHUB_TOKEN ([#134](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/java-sdk/issues/134)) ([478e8da](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/java-sdk/commit/478e8daa52381dde37167b349c7a2f8dfe36282a))


## [7.0.0](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/java-sdk/compare/6.1.0...7.0.0) (2026-06-05)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* See below.

**1.  — key filter renamed uid=1001(runner) gid=1001(runner) groups=1001(runner),4(adm),100(users),118(docker),999(systemd-journal) → **
The query parameter used to filter by application-key id was renamed to avoid colliding with the path uid=1001(runner) gid=1001(runner) groups=1001(runner),4(adm),100(users),118(docker),999(systemd-journal). Update the request builder:

The getter changed correspondingly ( → ).

**2.  — now returns **
The  success response no longer returns a body. Remove any code reading the old  return value.


**3.  — now paginated**
The return type changed from  to . Iterate the pager instead of reading the list off a wrapper object:


**4.  — method renamed**
Renamed from the auto-derived  to ; the request type was likewise renamed  → .


**5. Tenant owner transfer — moved and renamed**
The transfer-owner call moved off  and onto the  sub-resource, and it now accepts an idempotency key.


**6. Pagination class constructors gained an  parameter**
, , and both  constructors now take an extra  argument (inserted before the supplier). These types are created internally and returned from / methods, so **idiomatic consumers are not affected** — iteration (, , , ) is unchanged, and the generic arity is unchanged ( is still single-arg, so explicit type annotations still compile). This break only reaches code that constructs or subclasses a page type by hand, which is not an expected usage. A new additive  accessor exposes pagination metadata / cursor tokens.

### Behavioral changes (no code change required)

- **Retry timing now honors server hints.** Retries read the  and  response headers, apply ±20% jitter, and cap backoff at 60s, replacing the old fixed exponential backoff. The default  is unchanged (2). You'll see different retry *timing*, and retried requests respect server-specified delays.
- **** now serializes the body via the object mapper instead of emitting the raw object — different  output.  and  accessors are unchanged.
- **Error-body parsing hardened** — unmapped error responses parse through a dedicated path and an empty response body no longer NPEs.
- **Webhook / WebhookList builders are now null-tolerant** —  /  /  no longer throw on .
- **A logging interceptor is always installed but silent by default** — no output unless you opt in via .
